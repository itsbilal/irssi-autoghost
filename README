********* NOTICE: BEFORE INSTALLING **************
This script works ONLY if your 'nick' and 'alternate_nick' settings are set in Irssi and BOTH of them
are separate nicks which are registered to the SAME account in NickServ (see /msg NickServ help group for details).
If not, please register your first nick and then group the second one in. This needs to be done for the script to ghost nicks properly.
